# Fractol
This project is an introduction to 2D programming in C language using 42's self-made graphic library *MinilibX*. It is basically a frame, in which you can view different fractals such as :
- Mandelbrot
- Julia
- Burning ship
- Sierpinski carpet
- Multibrot
- Tricorn
- Bacteria (self named one that looks just like its name)

Those come in different color palettes and you get the possibility to move around and zoom in on different points.
